okay so for backend
what we did is 

1. we created a room instance where the only 2 user will be joiing if room contains 2 user then other cant join it and so on 

2. if 2 users are there then c1 will initate offer 

3. at frontend c2 recieves that offer via socket and it emits answer from there

4. we listen that answer here and again send that answer to c1

5. lastly we are listing for ice candidate and sending that to room 

6. lastly we handled disconnect one .
