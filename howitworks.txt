The whole system work like thiss ::
step1:
c1 sends its media condigs that is sdi sesion description information/offer  to the signalling server .

signalling server sends that offer to c2 ;

c2 acepts that offers and then answer its offer by providing answer which includes all media configs to it too . c2 also add the c1 offer to its remote address and adds its own answer  to local address and  send to signalling server .

signalling server recieves that answer and send to c1 c1 add its offer to local and answer to remote description 

after that c1 and c2 both goes for getting ice thats basically piblic ip and shares it via signalling server .
